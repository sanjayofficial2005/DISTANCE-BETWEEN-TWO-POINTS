# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```python

x1=int(10)
y1=int(6)
x2=int(4)
y2=int(2)
d2=(x2-x1)*(x2-x1)+(y2-y1)*(y2-y1)
d=d2**0.5
print(round(d,2))
```
